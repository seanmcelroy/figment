# Pomodoro

These commands implement the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.  It uses a simple timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used while a university student.
